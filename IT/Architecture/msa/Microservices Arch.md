# Microservices Architecture
 Microservice architecture is sweeping across web development replacing the classic monoliths. This is due to recent  explosion in cloud, devops, languages, nosql's and other technologies.

## What is a microservice?

    Micro -> Not macro and not nano. This is a domain based balance that needs to be applied to the software architecture.
    Service-> the implementation of a business problem limited to a specific domain.

In short, Microservice based architecture can be defined as "loosely coupled domain based bounded services"

Below diagram is a visual representation of world vs nano world vs microservice world.
