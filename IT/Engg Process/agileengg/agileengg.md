# Agile Engineering

## Disclaimer
* This technotes will not cover indepth implementation of any engg practices

There are 2 terms in this topic - "Agile" and "Engineering". Below is the definition that the document will adhere to and specifically to software engineering side.

## What is Agile?

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools <br>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation <br>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation <br>
> **Responding to change** over following a plan <br>

## What is Engineering?
> the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures.



## Software Engineering in Agile
> Simplicity-- is the key.<br>

The Reason for emergence of agile based software development is widely known and has been explored in depth. So we are not going to cover those. While we would be curious to understand and answer 2 important questions
* What changes in engineering would enable agile with zero impact on quality?
* 

### Time
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.<br>
> Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.<br>

### Scope and Quality
> Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage. <br>
> Working software is the primary measure of progress.<br>
> Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.<br>


### Integration
> Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.<br>

### Stakeholder
> Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.<br>
> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.<br>
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
